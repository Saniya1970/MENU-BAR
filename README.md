# MENU-BAR
A hamburger menu is a type of navigation menu that consists of three horizontal lines (resembling a hamburger) stacked on top of each other. When clicked or tapped, the menu expands to reveal the navigation links
Hamburger menus are commonly used in responsive web design because they take up less space and are easier to use on smaller screens. They also have a clean and minimalistic look that fits well with modern design trends.

<h6>Advantages of a Full-Screen Hamburger Menu</h6>
A full-screen hamburger menu expands to cover the entire screen when clicked or tapped, hiding the rest of the content temporarily. This provides a number of benefits for the user experience, particularly on mobile devices:

Simplifies Navigation: By hiding the rest of the content, a full-screen hamburger menu can simplify navigation by focusing on the most important links.
Saves Space: A full-screen hamburger menu takes up the entire screen, which can save valuable space on smaller screens.
Enhances User Control: By allowing the user to control when the menu appears and disappears, a full-screen hamburger menu gives users a greater sense of control over their experience.
